abstract = {Diagnosing performance problems in distributed applications is extremely challenging. A significant reason is that it is hard to know where to place instrumentation a priori to help diagnose problems that may occur in the future. We present the vision of an automated instrumentation framework, Pythia, that runs alongside deployed distributed applications. In response to a newly-observed performance problem, Pythia searches the space of possible instrumentation choices to enable the instru- mentation needed to help diagnose it. Our vision for Pythia builds on workflow-centric tracing, which records the order and timing of how requests are processed within and among a distributed applicationâ€™s nodes (i.e., records their workflows). It uses the key insight that localizing the sources high perfor- mance variation within the workflows of requests that are ex- pected to perform similarly gives insight into where additional instrumentation is needed.},

abstract = {Current caching methods for improving the performance of big-data jobs assume high (e.g., full bi-section) bandwidth; however many enterprise data centers and co-location facilities have large network imbalances due to over-subscription and incremental networking upgrades. We describe D3N, a multi-layer cooperative caching architecture that mitigates network imbalances by caching data on the access side of each layer of a hierarchical network topology, adaptively adjusting cache sizes of each layer based on observed workload patterns and network congestion. We have added (and submitted upstream) a 2-layer D3N cache to the Ceph RADOS Gateway; read bandwidth achieves the 5GB/s speed of our SSDs, and we show that it substantially improves big-data job performance while reducing network traffic.},
