<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am the Ankur &amp; Mari Sahu Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tufts University</a>. I mentor an incredible group of students at the <a href="https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">D.O.C.C. Lab</a>. Our work focuses on problem diagnosis techniques for distributed systems running in the cloud.</p> <p>From November of 2016 to July of 2019, I was a Red Hat Visiting Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.bu.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BU</a>. I worked on the <a href="https://massopen.cloud/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mass Open Cloud</a> project with <a href="https://okrieg.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Orran Krieger</a>, focusing on architectures for building vendor-neutral clouds and creating diagnosis tools for them. From May of 2013 to October of 2016, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CMU</a>. I worked on the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XIA</a> project with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Peter Steenkiste</a>, focusing on evolvability for inter-domain routing protocols. Our <a href="/assets/pdf/sambasivan2017jb_paper.pdf">SIGCOMM</a> paper showed that two simple mechanisms implemented within routing protocols would allow them to facilitate the deployment of future inter-domain routing protocols.</p> <p>I completed my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CMU</a> in May 2013, advised by <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Greg Ganger</a>. My dissertation, “Diagnosing performance changes in distributed systems by comparing request flows”, focused on creating distributed-tracing infrastructures and diagnosis tools that use them. The resulting papers (<a href="/assets/pdf/sambasivan2007uh_paper.pdf">HotAC</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/sambasivan2011vw_paper.pdf">NSDI</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/sambasivan2013gn_paper.pdf">InfoVis</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/sambasivan2016bo_paper.pdf">SoCC</a>) influenced industrial tracing efforts, such as Jaeger’s trace comparisons, and have been cited over 350 times.</p> <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis taking long walks, and exploring New England. I am “famous” for appearing in a <a href="https://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=824" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PhDComics</a> strip. In the strip, I ask CS PhD students to wear lab coats to work so that folks will know that we are researchers too <img class="emoji" title=":blush:" alt=":blush:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60a.png" height="20" width="20">. Don’t forget to pop on a pair of lab goggles when debugging!</p> <h2 id="research-opportunities">research opportunities</h2> <p><strong>Prospective PhDs</strong>: I recruit one to two PhD students per year to work to work on projects broadly related to systems and networking. I look for students who are curious, have strong technical skills, communicate well, and like exploring (slightly) crazy ideas. If you are interested, please <a href="https://gradase.admissions.tufts.edu/apply/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">apply to Tufts CS</a> and send me an email. The application deadline is September 15th, 2022 for Spring 2022 admission and December 15th, 2022 for Fall 2022 admission.</p> <p><strong>Tufts undergrads &amp; Master’s students</strong>: My lab hosts a few undergrads &amp; Master’s students every year. If you are interested, send me an email. It helps if you have already taken or are planning to take Cloud Computing (<a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/118" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CS 118</a>), Networking (<a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/112" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CS 112</a>), or Operating Systems (<a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/111" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CS 111</a>).</p> <h2 id="scheduling-meetings">scheduling meetings</h2> <p>Separately from class office hours, I am available for 15-minute meetings with Tufts undergrads and Master’s students between 5 pm and 6 pm on Fridays. You may book meeting slot up to two weeks in advance.
