I am the Ankur & Mari Sahu Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science
Department](https://www.cs.tufts.edu) at [Tufts
University](https://www.tufts.edu).  I mentor an incredible group of
students at the [D.O.C.C. Lab](https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu).  Our work
focuses on problem diagnosis techniques for distributed systems
running in the cloud.

From November of 2016 to July of 2019, I was a Red Hat Visiting
Research Scientist at [BU](https://www.bu.edu).  I worked on the [Mass
Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/) project with [Orran
Krieger](https://okrieg.github.io/), focusing on architectures for
building vendor-neutral clouds and creating diagnosis tools for them.
From May of 2013 to October of 2016, I was a postdoctoral researcher
at [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu).  I worked on the
[XIA](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/) project with [Peter
Steenkiste](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/), focusing on evolvability
for inter-domain routing protocols.  Our SIGCOMM paper showed that two
simple mechanisms implemented within routing protocols would allow
them to facilitate the deployment of future inter-domain routing
protocols.

I completed my Ph.D. at [CMU](https://www.ece.cmu.edu) in May 2013,
advised by [Greg Ganger](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger).  My
dissertation, "Diagnosing performance changes in distributed systems
by comparing request flows", focused on creating distributed-tracing
infrastructures and diagnosis tools that use them.  The resulting
papers (HotAC, NSDI, InfoVis, SoCC) influenced industrial tracing
efforts, such as Jaeger's trace comparisons, and has been cited over
350 times.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis taking long walks, and
exploring New England.  I am "famous" for appearing in a
[PhDComics](https://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=824)
strip. In the strip, I ask CS PhD students to wear lab coats to work
so that folks will know that we are researchers too <i class="fas
fa-grin-tongue"></i>.  Don't forget to pop on a pair of lab goggles
when debugging!
