I am the Ankur & Mari Sahu Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science
Department](https://www.cs.tufts.edu) at [Tufts
University](https://www.tufts.edu).  I mentor an incredible group of
students at the [D.O.C.C. Lab](https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu).  Our work
focuses on problem diagnosis techniques for distributed systems
running in the cloud.

From November of 2016 to July of 2019, I was a Red Hat Visiting
Research Scientist at [BU](https://www.bu.edu).  I worked on the [Mass
Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/) project with [Orran
Krieger](https://okrieg.github.io/), focusing on architectures for
building vendor-neutral clouds and creating diagnosis tools for them.
From May of 2013 to October of 2016, I was a postdoctoral researcher
at [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu).  I worked on the
[XIA](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xia/) project with [Peter
Steenkiste](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/), focusing on evolvability
for inter-domain routing protocols.  Our
[SIGCOMM](/assets/pdf/sambasivan2017jb_paper.pdf) paper showed that two simple
mechanisms implemented within routing protocols would allow them to
facilitate the deployment of future inter-domain routing protocols.

I completed my Ph.D. at [CMU](https://www.ece.cmu.edu) in May 2013,
advised by [Greg Ganger](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger).  My
dissertation, "Diagnosing performance changes in distributed systems
by comparing request flows", focused on creating distributed-tracing
infrastructures and diagnosis tools that use them.  The resulting
papers ([HotAC](/assets/pdf/sambasivan2007uh_paper.pdf),
[NSDI](/assets/pdf/sambasivan2011vw_paper.pdf),
[InfoVis](/assets/pdf/sambasivan2013gn_paper.pdf),
[SoCC](/assets/pdf/sambasivan2016bo_paper.pdf)) influenced industrial
tracing efforts, such as Jaeger's trace comparisons, and have been
cited over 350 times.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis taking long walks, and
exploring New England.  I am "famous" for appearing in a
[PhDComics](https://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=824)
strip. In the strip, I ask CS PhD students to wear lab coats to work
so that folks will know that we are researchers too :blush:.  Don't
forget to pop on a pair of lab goggles when debugging!


## research opportunities

**Prospective PhDs**: I recruit one to two PhD students per year to
work to work on projects broadly related to systems and networking.  I
look for students who are curious, have strong technical skills,
communicate well, and like exploring (slightly) crazy ideas.  If you
are interested, please [apply to Tufts
CS](https://gradase.admissions.tufts.edu/apply/) and send me an email.
The application deadline is September 15th, 2021 for Spring 2022
admission and December 15th, 2021 for Fall 2022 admission.

**Tufts undergrads & Master's students**: My lab hosts a few
undergrads & Master's students every year.  If you are interested,
send me an email.  It helps if you have already taken or are planning
to take Cloud Computing (CS 118) or Networking (CS 112).

## scheduling meetings

Seperately from class office hours, I am available for meetings with
Tufts undergrads and Master's students between 4:30 to 5:15pm on
Wednesdays.  Please use this
